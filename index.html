<p>One Direction, an English-Irish band based in London was composed of Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne. As a group they are best known for making "teen pop", however unfortunately, they broke up but continue as individual artists.  </p>
<h2> <bold> Early History <bold> <h2> 
<img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zayn_Malik#/media/File:Zayn_Wiki.jpg">
<p> Competing in X Factor, the British singing competition, judge Simon Cowell decided to group the five together. Almost instantly, this 
  new group gained popularity across the U.K. and eventually won 3rd place. Their final performance was claimed to have been leaked on the 
  Interenet which led to a 2 million dollar contract with Syco Records.

 <h3> <bold> Success and Departures <bold> <h3> 
   <p> <bold> Starting from humble beginnings, One Direction made their way to the top. <bold> Forbes in 2015 ranked them as the fourth 
     highest earning celebrities in the world and as of 2016 they have sold 50 million records worldwide. But suddenly band member Zayn 
     Malik, decided he would leave 1D to become an individual artist, upseting fans around the world. The others decided to stay together 
     for a year until they all decided to go their own ways in 2016 as solo artists.
